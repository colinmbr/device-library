# device-library
A library system built in Java to track the status of devices that I made while at ASU.

This program allows the user to add, update, and delete devices to be tracked. Additionally, the user can specify which device they would like to check out; the system tracks whether devices are already checked out or are available to check out. The user may also search by device name with close matches being returned.
